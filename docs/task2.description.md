### ArgoCD Tasks
1. **Set Up ArgoCD on a Kubernetes Cluster**
   - Install and configure ArgoCD on a Kubernetes cluster. Ensure it's properly integrated to manage deployments automatically from a Git repository.
   
2. **Create Application Definitions**
   - Define multiple applications in ArgoCD, each pointing to different branches or directories in a Git repository.

3. **Implement Blue-Green Deployment**
   - Configure ArgoCD for blue-green deployments, allowing you to switch traffic between two versions of an application to ensure minimal downtime and risk.

### Terraform Tasks
4. **Build Infrastructure with Terraform**
   - Write Terraform scripts to provision and manage infrastructure on StackIT (EKS cluster).

5. **Integrate Remote State Management**
   - Configure Terraform to use a remote state file stored in an S3 bucket.

### GitOps Tasks
6. **Set Up a GitOps Workflow**
   - Establish a GitOps workflow using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps Pipelines. This should include automatic updates and rollbacks based on Git commits.

7. **Version Control Configuration Files**
   - Use a Git repository to store and version control all your Kubernetes configuration files, and integrate this with ArgoCD for deployment.

### Azure DevOps Pipelines Tasks
8. **Create Multi-Stage Pipelines**
   - Design and implement a multi-stage pipeline in Azure DevOps for building, testing, and deploying a go application.

### GitHub Pipelines Tasks
9. **Automate Testing and Deployment with GitHub Actions**
    - Develop GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of a Go application.

10. **Secure Workflows with Secrets and Environment Variables**
    - Use GitHub secrets to manage sensitive information and environment variables to handle different deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

11. **Integrate Terraform with ArgoCD for Kubernetes Management**
    - Use Terraform to manage Kubernetes cluster resources and deploy these resources using ArgoCD to streamline the deployment process
